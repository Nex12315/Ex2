          <p>
            We believe that we are on the face of the earth to make great
            products and that's not changing. We are constantly focusing on
            innovating. We believe in the simple not the complex. We believe
            that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the
            products that we make, and participate only in markets where we can
            make a significant contribution. We believe in saying no to
            thousands of projects, so that we can really focus on the few that
            are truly important and meaningful to us. We believe in deep
            collaboration and cross-pollination of our groups, which allow us to
            innovate in a way that others cannot. And frankly, we don't settle
            for anything less than excellence in every group in the company, and
            we have the self-honesty to admit when we're wrong and the courage
            to change. And I think regardless of who is in what job those values
            are so embedded in this company that Apple will do extremely well."-
            Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Computer

            Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle's
            historic Pike Place Market. It was here where Starbucks opened its
            first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices
            from around the world for our customers to take home. Our name was
            inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring
            tradition of the early coffee traders. <br />
            Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz would walk
            through these doors and become captivated with Starbucks coffee from
            his first sip. After joining the company in 1982, a different
            cobblestone road would lead him to another discovery. It was on a
            trip to Milan in 1983 that Howard first experienced Italy's
            coffeehouses, and he returned to Seattle inspired to bring the
            warmth and artistry of its coffee culture to Starbucks. By 1987, we
            swapped our brown aprons for green ones and embarked on our next
            chapter as a coffeehouse. <br />
            Starbucks would soon expand to Chicago and Vancouver, Canada and
            then on to California, Washington, D.C. and New York. By 1996, we
            would cross the Pacific to open our first store in Japan, followed
            by Europe in 1998 and China in 1999. Over the next two decades, we
            would grow to welcome millions of customers each week and become a
            part of the fabric of tens of thousands of neighborhoods all around
            the world. In everything we do, we are always dedicated to Our
            Mission: to inspire and nurture the human spirit - one person, one
            cup, and one neighborhood at a time.
